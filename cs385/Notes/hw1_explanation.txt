Sieve of Eratosthenes
An algorithm for finding prime numbers in the range 2-->n

Step 1
    Mark indices 0 and 1 as false
Step 2
    Mark 2-->n as true
Step 3
    Starting with i as 2, going up to and including sqrt(n), mark all multiples of j starting at i^2 as false
Step 4
    Go to the next true value, and repeat step 3 with a new i value
