What is an algorithm?
    An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for soling a problem, ie for obaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time.
Important points
    1. The non-ambiguity requirement for each step of an algorithm cannot be compromised
    2. The range of inputs for which an algorithm works as to be specified carefully
    3. The same algorithm can be represented in several different ways
    4. There may exist several different algorithms for solving the same problem

problem -> algorithm -> computer
input -> computer -> output

Always ask for more clarification if you need it, especially for interview problems
